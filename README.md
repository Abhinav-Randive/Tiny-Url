# Tiny-Url
Project 1 - CS 230

This is the URL shortening lab for CS 230.

Building an application to store URL’s of any length and returning a shortened version of the URL in Python. 

Entering the shortened URL will return the full URL. Our project should protect against invalid URL’s. The format of the shortened URL will have a unique id that is less than 12 ASCII characters. 
We should be able to count the number of URL’s that have been shortened so far. 
We can accept user input as text given a prompt.

A valid URL looks like: “https://www.google.com/home?userId=12345&profile=abcdef”

A shortened URL could look something like: “https://myApp.com/short123”
